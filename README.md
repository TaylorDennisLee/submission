This is my submission for the Fetch Frontend Engineer Apprenticeship. I have a background of Python scripting, and so I found it easier to complete this exercise with just Javascript. I have also been working on a version that uses React, but that is not complete yet. If you feel this submission is not satisfactory, please let me know and I will submit the React version when it is complete. I don't have experience using React Hooks, and because you mentioned you wanted to see some object-oriented programming, I didn't know whether to make the react version with functions and hooks or just classes.

I am passionate about programming and would enjoy learning as part of an organization like fetch. I intend to apply to your backend apprenticeship as well.
